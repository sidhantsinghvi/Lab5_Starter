Part 3:
1. I agree that unit tests are suitable for testing singular features in isolation. Since the "message" feature involves user interaction with the messaging functionality, unit tests can effectively verify its behavior without being influenced by other factors. By isolating this feature, we can thoroughly test scenarios such as composing messages, sending them, and ensuring they're received correctly.
2. I wouldn't use a unit test for the "max message length" feature in a messaging app. This feature involves both user input and backend processing. While unit tests can handle backend validation, ensuring users don't exceed the character limit is better suited for frontend testing. So, I'd focus on frontend tests instead of unit tests to cover this aspect effectively.
